Coffee Automatic Freshwater Engine (C.A.F.E.nator) Automated Coffee Reservoir Fill System
The C.A.F.E.nator transforms your everyday coffee maker into an automatic, hassle-free brewing station by integrating an automated water refill system. This system draws water directly from a 1/4-inch line, typically teed from your refrigerator's ice maker supply, and monitors the water level using an IR sensor. The system is powered by an ESP8266 microcontroller running Tasmota for seamless control and monitoring.

No more carrying and spilling carafes of water! With the C.A.F.E.nator, your coffee maker will always have the perfect amount of water for brewing.
