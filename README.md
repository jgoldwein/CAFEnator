# CAFEnator
Coffee Automatic Freshwater Engine (C.A.F.E.nator)
The C.A.F.E.nator transforms your everyday coffee maker into an automatic, hassle-free brewing station by integrating an automated water refill system. This system draws water directly from a 1/4-inch line, typically teed from your refrigerator's ice maker supply, and monitors the water level using an IR sensor. The system is powered by an ESP8266 microcontroller running Tasmota for seamless control and monitoring.

Herein I will include all necessary information to build the system including PCB Gerber files, Schematics, Bill of Material, .stl files for 3D printing PCB, plumbing and other modules, and tasmota rules, backlog and other necessary files.  Full build instructions are likewise included.

No more carrying and spilling carafes of water! With the C.A.F.E.nator, your coffee maker will always have the perfect amount of water for brewing.

Enjoy.
